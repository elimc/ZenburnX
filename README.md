**ZenburnX**
============

**ZenburnX** is a dark-background, low-contrast theme for the NetBeans IDE

The latest version of ZenBurn is compatible with **NetBeans 7.3**.

What is the difference between **ZenburnX** and Zenburn2012?
------------------------------------------------------------

**ZenburnX** is the next-generation version of **Zenburn2012**. It is a "living" theme. This means that development of the theme will be run in parallel with NetBeans releases. For example, if the latest version of NetBeans is released (NetBeans IDE X.X), you should check to see if **ZenburnX** has been updated on GitHub.

About
-----

The main component of **ZenburnX** is "Fonts & Colors". It is specifically designed to allow hours of coding without making you want to stab your eyeballs out. Other components of the theme include my personal formatting preferences. The PHP formatting is based on the evolving PSR standard. The Fonts & Colors and formatting components can be installed separately.

FAQ
---

__Can I fork this theme, improve it, and send it back to you?__

Sure. Most of my work is in `PHP`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS`. If **ZenburnX** doesn't meet the needs of your language, go ahead and fork it and submit it to the master branch.

__Is **ZenburnX** the best NetBeans theme in the entire world?__

At this point, yes. It is possibly the best theme in the entire universe.

__**ZenburnX** should be the default theme for NetBeans.__

That's not a question, but the answer is yes.

__Are you dissapointed that the NetBeans IDE looks like it was design by Computer Science majors?__

Yes. But there isn't much I can do about it. The **ZenburnX** theme is the best I can do for the community at this point, unless the ability to change the look and feel gets better. I would love to make wireframes of the NetBeans interface to show them what their IDE could look like. Until then, we are stuck with the "Engineers Interface".

Installation
------------

If you are not used to cloning repositories in GitHub, download the archive called `ZenburnX.zip`. Now you must select the archive in NetBeans. Go to `Tools => Options => Font & Colors => Import => Browse...` Select the `All` button and then `OK`. **WARNING!** Make sure your work is saved before importing the theme. NetBeans will automatically restart to apply changes and you will lose any unsaved work.

If you download the entire git repository called `ZenburnX-master`, you will not be able to import this into NetBeans. There is a .zip file inside that .zip file. It is called `ZenburnX.zip`. This is the file that you need to import into **NetBeans**.
